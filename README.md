# mobile-app-ios
This is my work for my mobile app dev ios class. 
The class seems like it will be easy but I think I should still document my progress.

I've released several apps for IOS prior to this, but all using Unity and nothing built from
the ground up in XCode.

I've also had to write plugins for my development with Unity to expose native features all in
Objective-C, however this will be primarily Swift.
